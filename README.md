# FactoryTalk Optix Runtime logs parser

## Overview

This HTML file represents the main structure of a web-based application designed to parse FactoryTalk Optix runtime log files. The application allows users to upload `.log` files, process them, and view the parsed output in both raw and rendered Markdown formats. Additionally, users can download the parsed output as a Markdown file.

## Application Security

1. **File Upload Restrictions**:

    - The file input element (`<input type="file">`) restricts uploads to files with a `.log` extension using the `accept` attribute. This helps prevent users from uploading unsupported or potentially harmful file types.

2. **Client-Side Processing**:

    - All file processing appears to be handled on the client side using JavaScript (`scripts/uploader.js` and `scripts/processor.js`). This reduces the risk of server-side vulnerabilities, as no files are uploaded to a server for processing.

3. **File Handling**:

    - Uploaded files are temporarily stored in memory on the client side and are not persisted to any server or external storage. This ensures that sensitive log data remains on the user's device and is not exposed to external systems.

4. **Output Display**:

    - The parsed output is displayed within the browser using a `<pre>` element for raw output and a `<div>` for rendered Markdown. This ensures that the output is sandboxed within the browser environment, minimizing the risk of unintended execution of malicious content.

5. **Download Functionality**:

    - The application provides a button to download the parsed output as a Markdown file. This functionality is implemented entirely on the client side, ensuring that no data is transmitted to external servers.

## File Storage and Processing

1. **File Upload**:
    - Users upload `.log` files through the file input element (`<input type="file" id="logFiles">`). The selected files are displayed in a list (`<ul id="fileList">`) for user confirmation.

2. **File Processing**:

    - Uploaded files are processed by JavaScript code in `scripts/processor.js`. The processing logic parses the log data and converts it into a Markdown format.

3. **Output Storage**:

    - The parsed output is temporarily stored in memory and displayed in the `<pre>` element (`id="output"`) and the `<div>` element (`id="renderedMarkdown`). These elements are dynamically updated based on the user's actions.

4. **Download Location**:

    - The parsed output can be downloaded as a Markdown file using the "Download parsed output as Markdown" button (`id="downloadButton`). The file is generated and downloaded directly to the user's local file system without involving any server-side storage.

## Recommendations

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that additional validation is implemented in the JavaScript code to verify the contents of uploaded `.log` files, preventing potential abuse or injection attacks.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a strict CSP in the HTML `<head>` to prevent unauthorized scripts or styles from being executed.
- **Sanitization**: Sanitize any user-generated content or log data before rendering it in the browser to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
